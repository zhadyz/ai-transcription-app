## Configuration

### Docker Environment Variables

Modify `docker-compose.yml` to configure application behavior:

```yaml
backend:
  environment:
    - WHISPER_DEVICE=cuda           # Options: 'cuda', 'cpu'
    - WHISPER_MODEL=base            # Options: base, small, medium, large-v2, large-v3
    - WHISPER_COMPUTE_TYPE=float16  # Options: float16, float32, int8
    - MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB=5000         # Maximum upload size in megabytes
    - LOG_LEVEL=INFO                # Options: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
    - RATE_LIMIT_REQUESTS=10        # Requests per hour per IP
```

### Native Deployment Configuration

Create `backend/.env` for environment-specific settings:

```env
ENV=development
WHISPER_DEVICE=cuda
WHISPER_COMPUTE_TYPE=float16
WHISPER_MODEL=base
MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB=5000
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
LIBRETRANSLATE_URL=http://localhost:5000
RATE_LIMIT_REQUESTS=10
ENABLE_CORS=true
```

### GPU Configuration

**Disabling GPU Acceleration (Docker):**

Edit `docker-compose.yml`:
```yaml
backend:
  environment:
    - WHISPER_DEVICE=cpu
  # Comment out or remove:
  # deploy:
  #   resources:
  #     reservations:
  #       devices:
  #         - driver: nvidia
  #           count: 1
  #           capabilities: [gpu]
```

**Model Selection Considerations:**
- `base`: Fastest processing, moderate accuracy (recommended for testing)
- `small`: Balanced performance and accuracy
- `medium`: High accuracy, increased processing time
- `large-v2`: Maximum accuracy, requires 8GB+ VRAM
- `large-v3`: Latest model, highest accuracy, requires 8GB+ VRAM

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Deployment Issues

#### Python Version Incompatibility
```bash
# Verify Python version
python --version

# Required: Python 3.11.x (3.12+ incompatible with current PyTorch builds)
# Download: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3119/
```

#### Node.js Runtime Not Found
```bash
# Install Node.js 18.0 or later
# Download: https://nodejs.org/
# Verify installation: node --version
```

#### Port Conflict Detection
```bash
# Identify process using conflicting port
# Windows: netstat -ano | findstr :<PORT>
# Linux/Mac: lsof -i :<PORT>

# Terminate conflicting process or reconfigure application ports
```

#### FFmpeg Binary Not Found
```bash
# Windows: winget install ffmpeg
# macOS: brew install ffmpeg  
# Linux: sudo apt install ffmpeg

# Verify: ffmpeg -version
```

### Service Management

#### Log File Analysis
```bash
# View installer logs
cat scripts/installer.log

# Docker service logs
docker-compose logs -f
docker-compose logs -f backend
docker-compose logs -f frontend
```

#### Service Restart Procedure
```bash
# Automated service detection and initialization
python x.py
```

The installer binary functions as both deployment tool and service launcher, automatically detecting and initializing stopped services.

---

### Docker-Specific Issues

#### Docker Daemon Not Running
```bash
# Start Docker Desktop application
# Verify daemon status: docker info
# Initialize services: docker-compose up -d
```

#### Port 80 Already Allocated
```yaml
# Edit docker-compose.yml
frontend:
  ports:
    - "8080:80"  # Remap to alternative port
```

Access application via `http://localhost:8080`

#### GPU Not Detected in Container
```bash
# Verify NVIDIA Docker runtime installation
docker run --rm --gpus all nvidia/cuda:12.4.0-base-ubuntu22.04 nvidia-smi

# If command fails, install nvidia-container-toolkit
# Documentation: https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html
```

#### python-magic Library Issues
Platform-specific dependency automatically resolved:
- Linux containers: `python-magic==0.4.27`
- Windows native: `python-magic-bin==0.4.14`

---

### Native Deployment Issues

#### CUDA Detection Failure
```bash
# Verify CUDA availability
python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())"

# If False, reinstall PyTorch with CUDA support
pip uninstall torch torchaudio
pip install torch torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124
```

#### Translation Service Unavailable
```bash
# Verify LibreTranslate endpoint
curl http://localhost:5000/languages

# Docker deployment:
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 libretranslate/libretranslate

# Native installation:
pip install libretranslate
libretranslate --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000
```

#### Mobile Device Connection Failure

**Firewall Configuration:**
- Docker: Permit ports 80, 8000
- Native: Permit ports 5173, 8000, 8443

**Network Requirements:**
- Devices must be on identical network segment
- Verify IP address displayed in application matches workstation IP
- Windows: Configure Windows Defender Firewall exceptions

#### SSL/TLS Certificate Issues
```bash
# Regenerate self-signed certificates
cd backend
mkcert -install
mkcert localhost 192.168.1.* 192.168.*.* 127.0.0.1 ::1

# Verify certificate generation
ls -la localhost+*.pem
```

#### HTTP 413 Entity Too Large
```nginx
# Edit frontend/nginx.conf
http {
    client_max_body_size 5000M;  # Increase limit
}

# Rebuild container
docker-compose build frontend && docker-compose up -d
```

#### HTTP 405 Method Not Allowed
```python
# Verify CORS middleware configuration in backend/app/main.py
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["*"],
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)
```
